I hold a Ph.D. from New York University, specializing in wireless communication and machine learning applications for wireless systems. As a Senior Research Engineer at Samsung Research America, I have dedicated over two years to enhancing Samsung's 5G product portfolio. My work involves the development and implementation of advanced PHY algorithms across various software packages, significantly boosting throughput and coverage. These algorithms leverage cutting-edge signal processing techniques, heuristic approaches, and modern machine learning methodologies.
In addition to my industry experience, I have served as a teaching assistant at NYU, where I supported courses in machine learning for four semesters and internet architecture and protocols for two semesters.
